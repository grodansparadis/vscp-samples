Hi,

My first intention was to get reporpuse ELM for a CAN ready devboard,
but as I learned from the web, the chinese set the write protection
fuse.

The schematic is simple (most of it is OBD car stuff)
http://www.outilsobdfacile.com/interface/schema-interface-elm327.jpg
MCU: PIC18F2480 or PIC18F2580-I/SO (SOIC 28pin package), also I'm not a PIC=
 fan.

They use of the shelf UART-Bluetooth adapter.
FT232 or similar for USB
the black box here:
http://make.larsi.org/electronics/ELM327/
for $9 it's not money for it.
K=C3=B6sz=C3=B6nettel,
