What is DTGraph?
Stands for DigiTemp Graph(ing tool).

Digitemp is an application for reading temperature from 1-wire 
sensors and is just one way of sensing/recording temperature.  It is not 
written by me, nor is it a part of this project.

The purpose of this project is to provide a number of ways of 
monitoring temperature visually and even provide alerts for when things go
astray.

PROJECT STATUS:
The Application works and (I think) is fairly useable. 

INSTALLATION:
Please see the INSTALL file.

TODO:
Provide a means of perusing alarm history
